## Blue Eyes
100 blue-eyed and 100 brown-eyed logicians on an island without reflection and commuincation is forbidden. Anyone who figures out their own eye color is allowed to leave on on a ferry that comes once a day. Everyone can see everyone else's eyes colors, and they can see who leaves on the ferry.  On day 1, oracle arrives and announce that they see (at least one pair of) blue eyes, and the game commences.

Who leaves and on which day?

**Bonus question:** This is probably much harder than the question itself. What is the relevance of the orcale? i.e., "Everyone can already see that the are blue eyes".
